========

This is an experimental project to build tooling for Software Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing.
We hope it will become the standard for such processes for teams.
We have some exciting ideas to make it a good tool.

So in the next 6 months we will be working on this as an experiment and trying to validate its existence.

> NOTE: Highly experimental, in-development and definitely not ready for production use yet.
